Website Structure

Website structure is designed as the following:

Designed with the intention to separate the models, views, and controllers.
In the instance of this website the models would refer to the folder 'models'.
The folder 'templates' would correspond to the views of the website. And 
lastly the folder 'handlers' would correspond to the controllers.

A quick break down of what is in each folder for reference:

1. Handlers

	Handlers contains the actual methods in our website, they can gather 
	information, display information, request information and more. This
	is the backbone that is hidden to user.
	
2. Models
	
	Our entity that our database has actually created. Details about the Model
	inside.
	
3. Static

	Static Bootstrap stuff (CSS, Fonts, JS) inside. This is referred to in the 
	base.html and used throughout.
	
4. Templates

	Actual HTML for the website. Nothing too fancy here, most of the code for 
	the website is base.html which is extended into all of the other webpages.
	
==============================================================================

All of the folders contains an __init__ file. (Exception with static and 
templates). The purpose of this is to separate the code for readability. We 
technically can call all of the files in one big file, however that becomes 
cumbersome very fast.
